TieBar website mock-up

Pease refer to the document titled "1020_home 2.pdf" while putting your page together for Home: Mobile and Home: Desktop versions only.

Please ignore the Header Options in the document. Feel free to use your own images or image place holders where ever applicable. Dazzle us with your HTML / CSS and JavaScript skills by:
Making the page responsive
Make use of any framework and/or own favorite grid system. 
Should support both Desktop and mobile devices for Chrome/Safari/Firefox/IE latest browsers.

If your markup challenge submission requires extra steps to be viewed (rather than just dragging an html file onto a browser window), please consider adding a few notes describing the process. Spend as long, or as little, time as you see fit.
